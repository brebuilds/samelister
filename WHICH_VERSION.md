---

## 💬 Chat Interface (RECOMMENDED FOR MOBILE)

### Launch: `launch_chat.bat` or `./launch_chat.sh`

**Perfect for:**
- 📱 Using on iPhone/iPad
- 💬 Natural conversation style
- 🤔 When you're unsure about details
- 🎯 Processing 1-20 items at a time
- ✨ Wanting AI to ask questions first

**How it works:**
1. Send photos in chat
2. AI analyzes and asks questions
3. You answer conversationally
4. AI generates listing
5. Review and refine through chat
6. Save when happy

**Example:**
```
You: [uploads photo]
AI: "Nice shirt! What brand is it?"
You: "Nike size large"
AI: "Any stains or defects?"
You: "nope perfect condition"
AI: [generates listing]
You: "looks good"
AI: ✅ Saved!
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Natural conversation
- ✅ AI prevents bad data by asking first
- ✅ Perfect for iPhone (like WhatsApp)
- ✅ Easy to use
- ✅ Fun and interactive

**Cons:**
- ⏱️ Slower for large batches (100+ items)

## 📋 Form Interface (ORIGINAL)

### Launch: `launch.bat` or `./launch.sh`

**Perfect for:**
- 💻 Using on computer/laptop
- 📦 Processing 50-1000 items at once
- ⚡ Batch operations
- 🎯 When you know all details upfront

**How it works:**
1. Upload all photos in bulk
2. Select photos and assign SKUs manually
3. AI processes all groups at once
4. Edit all results in spreadsheet view
5. Export everything to CSV

**Example:**
```
1. Upload 500 photos
2. Select photos 1-5 → SKU: SHIRT001
3. Select photos 6-10 → SKU: PANTS001
4. Continue for all products
5. Click "Process All"
6. Edit in table view
7. Export CSV
```

**Pros:**
